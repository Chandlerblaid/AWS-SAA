# S3

## What is S3?
- S3 is a safe place to store your files.
- It is Object based storage i.e. allows you to upload files
	○ Flat-files
	○ Cannot install os this is for block based storage
- The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities
	○ Designed to withstand failure
- Pretty cheap
## S3 - The Basics
- Files can be up to 5TB
- There is unlimited storage
- Files are stored in Buckets
- S3 is a universal namespace, meaning, names must be unique globally
- When you upload a file to S3 you will receive http 200 code if upload was successful
- https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru
- Amazon guarantee 99.9% availability
- & 99.9999999999% durability for s3 info (11, 9s agreement)
- Tiered storage available
- Lifecycle management
- Versioning
- Encryption
- Secure your data using acls and bucket policies
## Data Consistency Model
- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
	○ Immediate consistency for new objects
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propogate)
## S3 is a simple key, value store
- S3 is Object based. Objects consist of the following:
	○ Key
		□ Could get performance bottleneck if filenames are similar
		□ To mitigate add a random salt to the beginning of the file
	○ Value (data, seq of bytes)
	○ Version ID
	○ Metadata
	○ Subresources
		□ Access Control Lists
		□ Torrent
## Storage Tiers/Classes
- S3 - 99% availability and durability, stored redundantly across multiple facilities and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.
- S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed) For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee.
- Reduced Redundancy Storage - Designed to provide 99.99% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year.
- Glacier - Very cheap, but used for archival only. It takes 3 - 5 hours to restore from Glacier.
	○ An extremely low-cost storage service for data archival. Amazon Glacier stores data for as little as $0.01 per gigabyte per month, and is optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and for which retrieval times of 3-5 hours are suitable.
## Charges
- Storage
- Requests
- Storage Management Pricing
- Data transfer pricing
- Transfer Acceleration
	○ Enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between you end user and an s3 bucket.
	○ Takes advantage of CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations.
	○ As data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to s3 over and optimized network path.
## Create an S3 Bucket - Exam Tips
- Buckets are universal name space
- Upload an object to s3 to receive a http 200 code
- S3, s3-ia, s3 Reduced Redundancy Storage
- Encryption
	○ Client side encryption
	○ Server Side Encryption
		□ Amazon s3 Managed Keys (sse-s3)
		□ KMS (sse-kms)
		□ Customer Provided Keys (sse-c)
- Control access to buckets using either a bucket acl or using bucket policies
- By Default Buckets are private and all objects stored inside them are private.
## Versioning - Exam Tips
- Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
- Great backup tool
- Once enabled, Versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended
- Integrates with Lifecycle rules
- Versioning's MFA Delete capability, which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security
## Cross Region Replication - Exam Tips
- Versioning must be enabled on both source and destination buckets
- Regions must be unique
- Files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically (Files already in the bucket before replication are not copied over). All subsequent updated files will be replicated automatically.
- You cannot replicate to multiple buckets or use daisy chaining (yet)
- Delete markers are replicated
- Deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated.
- Understand what Cross Region Replication is at a high level.
## Lifecycle management Lab
- Can be used in conjunction with versioning
- Can be applied to current versions and previous versions
- Following actions can now be done:
	○ Transition to the Standard - Infrequent Access Storage Class
		□ Must be 30 days after the creation date
		□ The file must be > 128Kb
	○ Archive to the Glacier Storage Class
		□ Must be in IA for 30 days, if relevant
		□ Permanently delete
## Security & Encryption
- Securing your buckets
	○ By default, all newly created buckets are private
	○ You can setup access control to your buckets using;
		□ Bucket Policies
		□ ACLs
	○ S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the bucket. This can be done to another bucket.
- Encryption
	○ In Transit:
		□ SSL/TLS
	○ At Rest:
		□ Server Side Encryption
			® S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3
			® AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys - SSE-KMS
				◊ Provides an audit trail of key usage
			® Server Side Encryption w/ Customer Provided Keys - SSE-C
		□ Client Side Encryption
			® You encrypt and then upload to s3
## Transfer Acceleration
- Get a special private link to upload files you want to store in s3 to an edge location. Amazon then sends that file through it's backbone to the specified s3 bucket. This makes the transfer much faster.
- S3-accelerate will be in the link.
## Static website hosting
- Endpoint:
	○ Http://<s3 bucket name>.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com
